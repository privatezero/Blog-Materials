# Introduction to a Bash Find Loop

Recently a lot of my work has involved processing legacy digital materials in order to generate/expand their associated metadata. As much of this work is file format specific, I often find myself trying to hunt down all examples of a certain file type spread across thousands of directories representing many terabytes worth of data. To do this I have been using the Bash `find` command. This allows me to generate lists of file paths which then can be looped through to perform actions as needed such as file validation and metadata generation. As I imagine that I am not the only one with vast amounts of legacy metadata to process, I wanted to write up a quick explanation of this process and hopefully save others some time!
