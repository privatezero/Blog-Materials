#Editing Documents in Browser via Github

Lots of documentation on GitHub is written in "GitHub Flavoured Markdown" (files that end in .md are markdown). There is a cheatsheet with pretty much everything you need to get started writing in this available [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
##Edit File Button
The first thing you will do is click the pencil icon of the file you would like to edit. If you hover your mouse over it it should say "edit this file."

##Edit and Preview Window
Next- Make your changes! You can toggle between the editing window and the preview window to see what your changes will look like.  __Just don't close this browser window__ or you will lose your work.  If you try to close the window it will warn you about this.

##Commit Changes
Once you are done with your edits, scroll down to the bottom of the page.  Here you can describe your changes and commit them!  Alternatively, you can cancel to discard your changes. (Closing the browser window without hitting 'commit' will essentially cancel as well).

##That's it! Ready to merge!
That's all there is to it!  If you were editing in a brach, after commiting you now could file a pull request to merge your changes!  There is a button for this at the top of your repository window.
